## Description
A simple web application written in Flask.
Created by the following link [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcZ9uJn8ffA) video.\
This is a simple application with two database tables: users and music_compositions.\
The idea is that users can register and add some music compositions (something like Instagram, but only for music and without any typical social networking elements).
## Instructions
Run:\
```sudo docker-compose up```
## Task List
 - [ ] Finish CRUD functionality for user (now only CRU)
 - [ ] Write CRUD functionaly for musical compositions
